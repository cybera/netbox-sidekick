# Contacts

## Managing Contacts

"Contacts" are people part of a member/membership.

Contacts have a Contact Type, such as Billing or Techncial. A Member
can have multiple contacts, such as multiple technical contacts.

When importing members, the CSV expects a single contact to be defined.
This is the "billing contact". In order to add additional contact types
and contacts, use the Django admin interface.
